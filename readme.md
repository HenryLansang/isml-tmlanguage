As of now, only tested in Sublime Text 2, but should work in TextMate and Sublime Text 3 as well.

Essentially an extended version of the HTML language grammar.

## Installation

Available through [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) as `ISML`

To manually install, `cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages` and clone this repo there.
