#TextMate Language Grammar (tmLanguage) for Demandware ISML

A grammar to get nice syntax highlighting for the poor souls who have to work on Demandware ISML, yet are smart enough to not use UXStudio.

As of now, only tested in Sublime Text 2, but should work in TextMate as well.

Essentially a modified version of the HTML language grammar.
